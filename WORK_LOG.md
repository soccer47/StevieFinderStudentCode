| Oct 25 |   5:30pm-6pm    |                                                                                                                                                      I began by spending 15 minutes wrapping my head around the problem, and then trying to think of a reasonable initial approach to solve this problem without writing any code. I decided that I will start by using a TST. I will then add the key-value pairs into the table line by line, using the ascii values of the key similar to how one would use the letters of the word to add it to the TST. I will also make an object for each key value pair, with the children nodes and the value. |
| Oct 26 |  8:45am-9:15am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I have begun implementing the TST approach. I will probably end up using classes similar to the ones I used in spellcheck. Additionally, I realized that there are a lot of similarities between adding a new word and adding a key with a value. I will therefore be able to make classes that are pretty similar to the ones I used in the spellcheck problem set, which is nice because it makes this approach less confusing. |
| Oct 26 |   9:30am-10am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I have continued to implement the TST approach. I am running into a bit of an issue because I don't know what to set the root of my TST to, because fo the different use cases of the table. I am also currently getting a nullPointer error for all of the cases, however I still think that I will be able to make it work. |
| Oct 26 |   5pm-5:30pm    |                                     After doing a bit of debugging, I realized that whenever you call the readLine function, a line of the csv is read over. Because of this, whenever I tried to check if there was another line to read in from the csv, I was actually skipping over a line by calling the readLine() function. I realized that I could instead just use the ready() function instead. By making this change and making a few other alterations, I actually got my code to work! My algorithm still goes over the given time for the longest test (testProducts), so my next step will be to make this code as efficient as possible |
| Oct 30 |  1:10pm-1:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I worked on trying to make my code more efficient so it would pass the largest case. I thought about altering the order of some of my lines, however I honestly wasn't able to make a lot of progress on increasing the runtime of my code. I also considered hashing the keys to increase efficiency, however I wasn't sure that this would actually decrease my runtime with this TST approach. |
| Nov 2  |   2:15pm-3pm    |                                                                                                  I started implementing the Hashmap approach with linear probing. I was able to write a first draft of all of the code, and found it pretty easy/intuitive to complete the Hashmap class, as well as all of the functions it contains. I just ran the new code for the first time, and I am currently getting an error message on the first test, and taking really long on the second one. I'm assuming the errors will be relatively easy to solve with this approach, however I might have to rethink my resize() method and make it more efficient. |
| Nov 2  |   3pm-3:10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I realized that I was incorrectly adding the key-value pairs to the new arrays in the resize() method. I fixed that section of code, and now my code works correctly. However, I still time out for the two larger tests, and my code takes a super long time for testProducts. I'm assuming that this may have something to do with my resize() method being too slow, but I'm not sure. |
| Nov 3  | 11:20am-11:50am |  I decided to make an object class for the key-value pairs, as this felt not only more intuitive for me, but also allowed me to only have to hash the key String once, as opposed to every time I resize the table (each keyVal object has the key, value, and hashed key). I also rationalized that the hash(), add(), and get() methods likely cannot be improved in terms of runtime categorically, and therefore I should focus mainly on my resize() method for now. I tried making a list of all the indexes where the keys were stored in order to make the resize method faster, however I still run out of time on the two largest test cases. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
