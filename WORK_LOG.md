| Oct 25 |  5:30pm-6pm   |                                                                                                                  I began by spending 15 minutes wrapping my head around the problem, and then trying to think of a reasonable initial approach to solve this problem without writing any code. I decided that I will start by using a TST. I will then add the key-value pairs into the table line by line, using the ascii values of the key similar to how one would use the letters of the word to add it to the TST. I will also make an object for each key value pair, with the children nodes and the value. |

I will probably end up using classes similar to the ones I used in spellcheck. Additionally, I realized that there are a lot of similarities between adding a new word and adding a key with a value. I will therefore be able to make classes that are pretty similar to the ones I used in the spellcheck problem set, which is nice because it makes this approach less confusing. |

I am running into a bit of an issue because I don't know what to set the root of my TST to, because fo the different use cases of the table. I am also currently getting a nullPointer error for all of the cases, however I still think that I will be able to make it work. |
| Oct 26 |  5pm-5:30pm   | After doing a bit of debugging, I realized that whenever you call the readLine function, a line of the csv is read over. Because of this, whenever I tried to check if there was another line to read in from the csv, I was actually skipping over a line by calling the readLine() function. I realized that I could instead just use the ready() function instead. By making this change and making a few other alterations, I actually got my code to work! My algorithm still goes over the given time for the longest test (testProducts), so my next step will be to make this code as efficient as possible |

I thought about altering the order of some of my lines, however I honestly wasn't able to make a lot of progress on increasing the runtime of my code. I also considered hashing the keys to increase efficiency, however I wasn't sure that this would actually decrease my runtime with this TST approach. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
