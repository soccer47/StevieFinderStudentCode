I decided that I will start by using a TST. I will then add the key-value pairs into the table line by line, using the ascii values of the key similar to how one would use the letters of the word to add it to the TST. I will also make an object for each key value pair, with the children nodes and the value. |

I will probably end up using classes similar to the ones I used in spellcheck. Additionally, I realized that there are a lot of similarities between adding a new word and adding a key with a value. I will therefore be able to make classes that are pretty similar to the ones I used in the spellcheck problem set, which is nice because it makes this approach less confusing. |

I am running into a bit of an issue because I don't know what to set the root of my TST to, because fo the different use cases of the table. I am also currently getting a nullPointer error for all of the cases, however I still think that I will be able to make it work. |

Because of this, whenever I tried to check if there was another line to read in from the csv, I was actually skipping over a line by calling the readLine() function. I realized that I could instead just use the ready() function instead. By making this change and making a few other alterations, I actually got my code to work! My algorithm still goes over the given time for the longest test (testProducts), so my next step will be to make this code as efficient as possible |

I thought about altering the order of some of my lines, however I honestly wasn't able to make a lot of progress on increasing the runtime of my code. I also considered hashing the keys to increase efficiency, however I wasn't sure that this would actually decrease my runtime with this TST approach. |

I was able to write a first draft of all of the code, and found it pretty easy/intuitive to complete the Hashmap class, as well as all of the functions it contains. I just ran the new code for the first time, and I am currently getting an error message on the first test, and taking really long on the second one. I'm assuming the errors will be relatively easy to solve with this approach, however I might have to rethink my resize() method and make it more efficient. |

I fixed that section of code, and now my code works correctly. However, I still time out for the two larger tests, and my code takes a super long time for testProducts. I'm assuming that this may have something to do with my resize() method being too slow, but I'm not sure. |

I also rationalized that the hash(), add(), and get() methods likely cannot be improved in terms of runtime categorically, and therefore I should focus mainly on my resize() method for now. I tried making a list of all the indexes where the keys were stored in order to make the resize method faster, however I still run out of time on the two largest test cases. |

I was able to improve my hash function by using a radix, and that made my code faster by decreasing the size of larger clusters. However, my code is still very slow for the larger cases, especially testProducts(), and I can't think of any ways to make my add() and get() methods any faster. |
| Nov 4  |  5:35pm-6:15pm  | I went for a walk to come up with ways to make my code more efficient, and I first realized that I call the resize() method far more that necessary by starting my hashmap size too small, and through some trial and error experimenting I realized I could decrease my runtime by 66% for testProducts by making the default size 100,000. I also rationalized that the main reason my code was taking so long was that I was getting a lot of long clusters, and therefore that I should focus on making my hash method output more diverse hashed values for each key. I ended up adding the last digit multiplied by a 6 digit prime number to the hash value, which made my code much faster as a result. I now pass all 3 of the smaller test cases, and take just over 2.5 seconds for testProducts. I will make more changes to my hash method so that the code can pass testProducts. |

In my hash() method I tried adding the values of the first and middle characters, each multiplied by a large number, in order to increase diversification of the hashed keys and reduce cluster clumping, and it actually made my code a lot faster. I now complete the entire test in 1.4 seconds. |
